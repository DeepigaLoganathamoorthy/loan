# Family Loan Tracker (Streamlit + Google Sheets)

A loan management system built for simple, safe, cloud-based tracking of:
- Borrowers
- Loan principals
- Interest repayments
- Monthly income summaries

Hosted on **Streamlit Cloud**, using **Google Sheets** as the database.

This app is designed so that a non-technical user (e.g., a family member) can easily
enter payments, while the backend automatically calculates:

- Remaining principal
- Remaining interest
- Profit (interest)
- Monthly collections
- Borrowers with pending dues
